# Text-Processing-Fundamentals-using-MapReduce
## Overview
The goal of this project is to prepare text data for text classification tasks by selecting terms that discriminate well between categories. The implemented MapReduce jobs calculate chi-square values for unigram terms in the Amazon Review Dataset and order the terms according to their discriminative power per category.
